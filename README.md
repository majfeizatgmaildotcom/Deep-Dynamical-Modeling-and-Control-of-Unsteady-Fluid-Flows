# Deep Dynamical Modeling and Control of Unsteady Fluid Flows Paper Review

## Review Summary:
This paper proposes applying ML in modeling the vortex around a cylinder and a control method to suppress the vortex. The paper presented a method for learning the forced and unforced dynamics of airflow over a cylinder directly from CFD data. Additionally, by performing model predictive control with the learned dynamical models, The Auther was able to find a straightforward, interpretable control law for suppressing
vortex shedding in the wake of the cylinder.
